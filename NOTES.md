Type files that still have to be cleaned from cereal/cereal.hpp include:
    !!! memory (transitive via cereal/traits/shared_from_this.hpp)
    base_class
    polymorphic
    common (archives will need cereal.hpp anyways, common is included after each archive (not by user), so this one is not that important)
