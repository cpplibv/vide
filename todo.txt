Type files that still have to be cleaned from vide/vide.hpp include:
    !!! memory (transitive via vide/traits/shared_from_this.hpp)
    base_class
    polymorphic
    common (archives will need vide.hpp anyways, common is included after each archive (not by user), so this one is not that important)




















SizeTag is still a bit wierd





vide: Safe reserve: get rid of unsafe reserves / resizes in serializers
		This includes every:
			vide/types
			libv/serial/types
			libv/utility/entity/entity_ptr_serial
			libv/container/small_vector_serial
			any *_serial file that serializes a size_type
		resize / reserves can be allowed it their memory footprint is smaller than the rest of the buffer
		archive buffer size detection
vide: Archive.reset() (close archive, and clear every state in the archive, but keep allocated memory, make it reusable)
vide: Archive.finish() or .flush() similar to reset()
vide: size_type from dependent name: Archive.size(v.size()) or Archive::SizeTag or other option
vide: binary from dependent name: Archive.as_binary() / Archive.can_serialize_as_binary<T>()
vide: .nvp -> do not always create NVP, let the archive decide

update version numbers, update patch notes, release 2.3.0
